## üöÄ Installation & Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/amit-chakdhare09/Enhanced-MediaPipe-Pose-Estimation.git
   cd enhanced-mediapipe-pose
   ```

2. **Update the input video path**:
   ```python
   INPUT_VIDEO = "path/to/your/video.mp4"
   ```

3. **Run the processing or Run on Colab**:
   ```bash
   python enhanced_pose_estimation.py
   ```

4. **Output**: Enhanced video will be saved as `Output_Video_Enhanced_v1.mp4`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### MediaPipe Settings
```python
pose = mp_pose.Pose(
    static_image_mode=False,
    model_complexity=2,              # Maximum accuracy (0-2)
    smooth_landmarks=True,           # Built-in smoothing
    enable_segmentation=True,        # Better pose detection
    smooth_segmentation=True,
    min_detection_confidence=0.7,    # Increased from default 0.5
    min_tracking_confidence=0.7      # Increased from default 0.5
)
```

### Temporal Smoothing Parameters
```python
smoother = PoseSmoother(
    window_size=5,                   # Frames for averaging (3-10 recommended)
    alpha=0.7                        # Exponential smoothing factor (0.5-0.9)
)
```

### Visualization Thresholds
```python
confidence_threshold=0.3             # Minimum visibility for rendering
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. PoseSmoother Class
- **Temporal Smoothing**: Exponential weighted averaging across multiple frames
- **Jitter Reduction**: Maintains pose history buffer for stable tracking
- **Confidence Weighting**: Recent frames have higher influence on final pose

#### 2. Frame Enhancement Pipeline
```
Input Frame ‚Üí CLAHE Enhancement ‚Üí Bilateral Filtering ‚Üí 
MediaPipe Processing ‚Üí Landmark Interpolation ‚Üí 
Temporal Smoothing ‚Üí Skeleton Visualization
```

#### 3. Visualization Engine
- **Adaptive Rendering**: Line thickness (2-5px) and colors based on confidence scores
- **Dynamic Joints**: Circle size (3-7px) varies with landmark visibility
- **Confidence Bar**: Real-time pose detection quality indicator
- **Fallback Display**: Uses previous frame data when current detection fails

### Advanced Features

#### Smart Interpolation Algorithm
```python
def interpolate_missing_landmarks(current, previous, threshold=0.3):
    # For landmarks below confidence threshold:
    # new_landmark = current * (confidence/threshold) + previous * (1 - confidence/threshold)
```

#### Exponential Weighted Smoothing
```python
# Recent frames get higher weights
weights = [alpha^(n-1-i) for i in range(n)]  # where n = window_size
smoothed_landmark = weighted_average(landmark_history, weights)
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

The system tracks and displays:
- **Processing Progress**: Frame-by-frame completion status
- **Detection Success Rate**: Percentage of frames with successful pose detection
- **Average Confidence**: Mean confidence scores across all detected poses
- **Processing Speed**: Frames per second processing rate

Example output:
```
‚úÖ Enhanced MediaPipe Pose Skeleton video saved as: Output_Video_Enhanced_v1.mp4
üéâ Processed 1247 frames successfully!
üìä Statistics:
   - Frames with detected pose: 1198/1247 (96.1%)
   - Average pose confidence: 84.3%
```

## üé® Customization Options

### Skeleton Appearance
```python
# Confidence-based styling
thickness = int(2 + 3 * avg_confidence)        # Line thickness (2-5px)
color = (int(255 * confidence), 255, 255)      # White to cyan gradient
radius = int(3 + 4 * landmark.visibility)      # Joint size (3-7px)
```

### Smoothing Behavior
```python
# More aggressive smoothing
window_size=7,      # More frames for averaging
alpha=0.8,          # Higher recent frame influence

# Lighter smoothing  
window_size=3,      # Fewer frames
alpha=0.5,          # More distributed weighting
```

### Output Format
```python
# Different video codec
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')  # or 'H264', 'MJPG'

# Adjust output resolution
output_width = frame_width * 2  # Side-by-side
output_height = frame_height    # Same height
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low detection rates:**
- Increase lighting in recording environment
- Ensure full body is visible in frame
- Lower `min_detection_confidence` to 0.5 or 0.6

**Too much smoothing:**
- Reduce `window_size` to 3-4 frames
- Lower `alpha` value to 0.5-0.6

**Jittery skeleton:**
- Increase `window_size` to 6-8 frames  
- Increase `alpha` value to 0.8-0.9
- Lower `confidence_threshold` to 0.2

## üìà Performance Benchmarks

Tested on various video types:
- **Dance Videos**: 95%+ detection rate, 85%+ average confidence
- **Sports Activities**: 90%+ detection rate, 80%+ average confidence  
- **Casual Movement**: 98%+ detection rate, 90%+ average confidence

Processing speed: ~15-25 FPS on modern hardware (depends on video resolution and frame rate)
